IBM cloud project details and files as well the complete project files
in this repo i have uploaded my full project ppt the dataset i've used and the result i've got.

i have choose the projblem statement number 39 and that was 

Mechanical Engineering: (Machine Learning project)
Problem statement No.39 – Predictive Maintenance of Industrial Machinery
The Challenge:
Develop a predictive maintenance model for a fleet of industrial machines to anticipate
failures before they occur. This project will involve analyzing sensor data from machinery
to identify patterns that precede a failure. The goal is to create a classification model that
can predict the type of failure (e.g., tool wear, heat dissipation, power failure) based on
real-time operational data. This will enable proactive maintenance, reducing downtime
and operational costs.

Technology – Use of IBM cloud lite services is mandatory.
